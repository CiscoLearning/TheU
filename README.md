# The U.

## What is The U.?
The U. is a "learn by doing" technical series where the host walks through the learning objectives step-by-step with the learner.   

- 15-30 min video
- videos cover all topics, Cisco products, and adjacent tech (AWS, Terraform and more...)
- SME does the lab/code/steps ... etc., on video, walking the learner through it step by step
- [Optional] Lab Guide is attached to each video, tied to a Cisco U. tutorial or L&C GitHub Repo 

#### To give you an idea, here are a couple of episodes:
- [Ep01 - Fun with Python Strings](https://cisco.box.com/s/dozsr503unwz4b6ld8lraqdc4vs2vi1v)
- [Ep02 - Build a Netmiko Script](https://cisco.box.com/s/tlqqg2thdxx2rrar85cp25l19oqyi565)

The goal for these videos is to be focused on teaching one topic, not just for coding or automation, but all the topics within Learning & Certs, such as networking, security, etc. Try to think of topics that you struggled with and cover a variety of difficulty from beginner to expert. Some videos may focus on teaching an introduction to something for a beginner, while others may be a deeper dive on a topic for a more dedicated audience. 

These are different than [Snack Minute](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2AuQ_ZjCjsq_dipCVvUS7enTwk4_P7n5) because they are more in depth and are in a tutorial, step-by-step format instead of an interview / demo structure that Snack Minute follows. 

## How do I contribute to The U.?

Simple! 

1. Find a topic relevant to the content (Learning Paths, Courses) in [Cisco U](https://u.cisco.com).
2. Start the video with **"Welcome to another episode of The U., My Name is ... "** introduce yourself and the topic.
3. Use [this slide](./assets/slide/TheU.-opening-slide-template.pptx) to outline the learning objective and steps you will cover.
4. Use a video recording tool. I recommend using [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html). It will require some budget, but is worth the cost.
5. Share your Camtasia project to this [Sharepoint folder](https://cisco-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/p/kiskande/EowWTE53y59NohbuMuPo1XABEKEN8tXJNRWKXbsjBV_M6g?e=HmT8AO)
   1. Create a new folder with the episode number, episode title, and your initials, for example, `EP01-Fun with python Strings-KI.`
   2. Extract your Camtasia project and upload it to the newly created folder [here's how to extract your project](https://www.techsmith.com/learn/tutorials/camtasia/project-files/)
6. If you use a recording tool other than Camtasia, share your raw footage at high-res.

⚠️ **Do not spend time editing your recording. We will take care of that part. Simply share the footage as is**
